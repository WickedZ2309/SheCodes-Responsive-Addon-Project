            <h2>Why London?</h2>
            <h3>London, the Square Mile</h3>
            <p>
              The City of London, also known as the Square Mile, is the
              financial district of London. It is the ancient core from which
              the rest of London developed. It has been a centre for settlement,
              trade, commerce and ceremony since the Roman period, producing a
              unique historic environment of exceptional richness and
              significance.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the reasons the Square Mile is unique, is the number of
              people who live, work and visit. In just 1.12 square miles, the
              City of London counts 8,600 residents, 614,500 workers and
              millions of domestic and international visitors. The City of
              London boundaries(external link) stretch from Temple to the Tower
              of London, on the River Thames including, from west to east
              Chancery Lane and Liverpool Street.
